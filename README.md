# 🧠 Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This repository contains practical implementations of **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** using **classifiers** and **regressors** with different kernel functions. The goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of SVMs on both classification and regression tasks using Python and scikit-learn.

## 📌 Features

- SVM Classifiers with:
  - Linear Kernel
  - Polynomial Kernel
  - RBF (Radial Basis Function) Kernel
- SVM Regressors:
  - Linear SVR
  - Polynomial SVR
  - RBF SVR
- Synthetic and real-world datasets
- Data visualization for decision boundaries
- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, MSE, and R² score

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- scikit-learn
